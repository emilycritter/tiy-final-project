  user.bio = "Koby Feldmos, 32 years old (born May 3rd, 1983), Israeli painter born in Tel Aviv. Koby studied at the Art School in Tel Aviv, descendant of a family of jewelers, he specialized in gold and diamonds and designing jewelry in the family business. In recent years, Feldmos abandoned jewelry design in favor of painting. Painting is something he dealt with in the past, and today dedicates himself fully to the craft of painting, as well as developing a style that distinguishes him on the national stage as well as on the international stage in the 21st century.
  The artistâ€™s picturesque style is inspired by the French movement which developed in Post Impressionism in the 19th century, Pointillism. This technique is expressed in paintings which are made up of points. "

  Each one of my paintings is original and hand painted. I usually paint on canvas, but I particularly enjoy painting on reclaimed items, like vinyl records, wood pallets or doors. I also paint custom portraits or other personalized paintings.
  Much of my art celebrates the work of other American artists. Jimi Hendrix, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Johnny Cash and Elvis just to name a few. These Americans are my heroes. "

  Although I opened the account in 2011, I started listing on Etsy in 2013. I hope you enjoy my art!
  I love to paint cats and dogs. If you send your pet's photos to kimstenbergart [!at] gmail.com, I will make beautiful pet portraits out of them. My pet portraits make perfect presents. "
